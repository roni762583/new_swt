- ✅ Designed reconciliation event system with full auditability
- ✅ Updated README with complete system documentation

### **Phase 2: Broker Position Query System** ✅ COMPLETED  
- ✅ Implemented broker position query with exponential backoff retry logic
- ✅ Created position comparison and discrepancy detection algorithms
- ✅ Built comprehensive reconciliation workflow with error handling

### **Phase 3: Startup Reconciliation Logic** ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Integrated reconciliation initialization into trading system startup
- ✅ Added broker state synchronization on container startup  
- ✅ Implemented position state restoration from broker data

### **Phase 4: Real-time Position Verification** ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Added post-trade reconciliation checks after every trade execution
- ✅ Integrated verification hooks into buy/sell/close operations
- ✅ Implemented immediate discrepancy detection and alerting

### **Phase 5: Position Feature Validation** ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Created position feature validation for ML inference accuracy
- ✅ Added broker-to-internal state synchronization  
- ✅ Implemented automatic position correction for discrepancies

### **Phase 6: Periodic Reconciliation Checks** ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Added 5-minute periodic health checks
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive monitoring and statistics tracking
- ✅ Created reconciliation performance metrics logging

### **Phase 7: Edge Cases and Recovery** ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ **Container restart recovery**: Restores account state from persistent sessions
- ✅ **Network disconnection recovery**: Tests connectivity and implements retry logic  
- ✅ **Partial fill handling**: Detects and adjusts positions for partial executions
- ✅ **Error recovery framework**: Multi-retry system with exponential backoff

### **Phase 8: Comprehensive Testing and Validation** ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Created comprehensive test framework (`test_reconciliation_system.py`)
- ✅ Built integration validation script (`validate_reconciliation_integration.py`)
- ✅ Verified all integration points and error handling paths

### **Key Integration Points**:

```python
# 1. System Initialization
async def _initialize_position_reconciliation(self):
    self.position_reconciler = BrokerPositionReconciler(
        broker_api=self.oanda_executor.api,
        account_id=self.oanda_executor.account_id,
        instruments=["GBP_JPY"],
        reconciliation_interval_seconds=300
    )

# 2. Startup Reconciliation  
async def _startup_reconciliation(self):
    reconciliation_results = await self.position_reconciler.startup_reconciliation()
    # Sync internal state with broker position

# 3. Post-Trade Verification
async def _post_trade_reconciliation_check(self, trade_type: str):
    current_internal = self._get_current_internal_position()
    result = await self.position_reconciler.perform_reconciliation(
        instrument="GBP_JPY",
        current_internal_position=current_internal,
        event_type=f"post_{trade_type}"
    )

# 4. Periodic Health Checks (Every 5 minutes)
async def _periodic_reconciliation_check(self):
    # Automated reconciliation with comprehensive monitoring

# 5. Edge Case Recovery
async def _handle_container_restart_recovery(self):
async def _handle_network_recovery(self):
async def _handle_partial_fill_recovery(self):
```
