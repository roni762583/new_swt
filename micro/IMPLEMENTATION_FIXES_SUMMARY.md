# Implementation Fixes Summary - Micro Stochastic MuZero

## Date: September 19, 2025

## âœ… Completed Fixes

### 1. **Replaced QualityExperienceBuffer with BalancedReplayBuffer**
- **Previous**: Complex TD-error prioritization with Î±=0.7, Î²=0.5
- **Fixed**: Simple FIFO buffer with 30% trade quota
- **File**: `micro/training/train_micro_muzero.py`
- **Key Changes**:
  - Removed all TD-error tracking and priority sampling
  - Implemented quota-based eviction (maintains 30% trading experiences)
  - Simple random sampling without importance weights
  - Buffer capacity: 10,000 (reduced from 50,000)
  - Min buffer size: 100 (reduced from 3,600)

### 2. **Implemented Rolling StDev-Based Outcome Thresholds**
- **Configuration**: 0.5Ïƒ based on 20-period rolling standard deviation
- **File**: `micro/utils/market_outcome_calculator.py`
- **Outcomes**:
  - UP: price change > 0.5 Ã— rolling_stdev
  - NEUTRAL: price change within Â±0.5 Ã— rolling_stdev
  - DOWN: price change < -0.5 Ã— rolling_stdev
- **Improvement**: Now calculates stdev from returns (not raw prices)

### 3. **Configured MCTS for 3Ã—3 (3 outcomes, depth 3)**
- **Files**: `micro/training/train_micro_muzero.py`, `micro/training/stochastic_mcts.py`
- **Configuration**:
  - Simulations: 50 (increased from 25)
  - Depth limit: 3 (fixed - sweet spot for trading)
  - Outcomes: 3 (UP/NEUTRAL/DOWN)
  - Discount: 0.997 (unchanged)
  - Dirichlet Î±: 1.0 (strong exploration)

### 4. **Implemented V7-Style AMDDP1 Reward System**
- **File**: `micro/training/episode_runner.py`
- **Previous**: Incorrect piecewise function without drawdown tracking
- **Fixed**: V7-style formula: `pnl_pips - 0.01 * cumulative_dd_sum`
- **Key Features**:
  - Tracks cumulative drawdown increases during positions
  - Uses 1% penalty factor (0.01) instead of 10%
  - Includes profit protection (profitable trades never negative)
  - Based on proven V7 MuZero implementation

### 5. **Fixed Training Configuration**
- **Learning rate**: 0.002 (FIXED - no decay)
- **Temperature decay**: 10.0 â†’ 1.0 over 50k episodes
- **Buffer**: Balanced with trade quota (no priority replay)

## ðŸ“Š Test Results

All implementation fixes have been validated:
- âœ… BalancedReplayBuffer maintains 30% trade quota
- âœ… MarketOutcomeCalculator uses rolling stdev correctly
- âœ… MCTS configured for 3Ã—3 with 50 simulations
- âœ… Training config matches README specs
- âœ… All tests pass (`test_implementation_fixes.py`)

## ðŸŽ¯ Alignment with Discussion Recommendations

### From ChatGPT Discussion:
1. **"3 outcomes at depth 3"** - âœ… Implemented
2. **"Rolling stdev with 0.5Ïƒ thresholds"** - âœ… Implemented
3. **"Simple buffer without TD-error"** - âœ… Implemented
4. **"Fixed learning rate"** - âœ… Implemented (0.002)
5. **"50 simulations in MCTS"** - âœ… Implemented

### Key Insight from Discussion:
> "Depth 2-3 is the sweet spot for trading - enough to see through noise but not so deep that you're pretending to predict beyond realistic horizons."

This is now enforced with `depth_limit=3` in the configuration.

## ðŸ”„ Next Steps

The system is now aligned with both the README documentation and the strategic recommendations from the discussion. Key improvements:

1. **Simplified buffer** reduces training variance
2. **Rolling stdev thresholds** filter market noise effectively
3. **3Ã—3 configuration** balances compute and foresight
4. **No learning rate decay** improves stability

The implementation is ready for training with the corrected architecture that should prevent hold-only collapse through proper stochastic modeling and balanced experience replay.
