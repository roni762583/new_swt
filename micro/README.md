# 🎯 Micro Stochastic MuZero Trading System
## COMPREHENSIVE TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION - v2.0.0

## Executive Summary

Production-grade **Stochastic MuZero** implementation for ultra-high-frequency forex trading (1-minute bars) using 15 carefully selected features. This system solves the Hold-only collapse problem through explicit market uncertainty modeling with discrete outcomes and stochastic planning.

### Core Innovation: Stochastic Market Uncertainty Modeling

The system models market uncertainty through:
- **3 Discrete Market Outcomes**: UP (>0.5σ), NEUTRAL (±0.5σ), DOWN (<-0.5σ)
- **Chance Nodes in MCTS**: Alternating decision/chance layers for stochastic planning
- **Outcome Probability Networks**: Neural networks that predict market outcome distributions
- **Rolling Standard Deviation**: Adaptive thresholds based on 20-period volatility

### Model Statistics
- **Total Parameters**: 2,338,802
- **Device**: CPU (intentionally for consistency)
- **Memory Usage**: ~2.8GB during training

## 🎮 Action Space & Trading Logic

### Actions (4 discrete actions)
```python
0: HOLD   # Maintain current position or stay flat
1: BUY    # Open long position (ONLY when flat)
2: SELL   # Open short position (ONLY when flat)
3: CLOSE  # Close current position (ONLY when positioned)
```

### Position Rules (Enforced)
- **Single Position Only**: No pyramiding or position scaling
- **State Machine**: Flat → Position → Flat (no direct reversals)
- **Invalid Action Handling**: -1.0 reward penalty

---

## 💰 Reward System - EXACT Implementation

### Current Implementation (from code)

```python
def _calculate_action_reward(action, position, entry_price, current_price):

    if action == HOLD (0):
        if position != 0:  # In position
            reward = 0.0    # Neutral during trades
        else:  # Flat
            reward = -0.05  # Small penalty for idle

    elif action == BUY (1):
        if position == 0:  # Valid entry
            reward = 1.0    # Immediate decisive action reward
            position = 1
        else:  # Already positioned
            reward = -1.0   # Invalid action penalty

    elif action == SELL (2):
        if position == 0:  # Valid entry
            reward = 1.0    # Immediate decisive action reward
            position = -1
        else:  # Already positioned
            reward = -1.0   # Invalid action penalty

    elif action == CLOSE (3):
        if position != 0:  # Have position
            # Calculate P&L with 4 pip spread
            if position == 1:  # Long
                pnl_pips = (current_price - entry_price) * 100 - 4
            else:  # Short
                pnl_pips = (entry_price - current_price) * 100 - 4

            reward = calculate_amddp1(pnl_pips)
        else:  # No position
            reward = -0.5   # Invalid close penalty

    return np.clip(reward, -3.0, 3.0)
```

### AMDDP1 Calculation (Asymmetric Mean Deviation Drawdown Penalty)

```python
def _calculate_amddp1(pnl_pips):
    if pnl_pips > 0:  # Profitable
        if pnl_pips < 10:
            return 1.0 + pnl_pips * 0.05
        elif pnl_pips < 30:
            return 1.5 + (pnl_pips - 10) * 0.025
        else:
            return 2.0 + np.tanh((pnl_pips - 30) / 50)
    else:  # Loss
        pnl_abs = abs(pnl_pips)
        if pnl_abs < 10:
            return -1.0 - pnl_abs * 0.1
        elif pnl_abs < 30:
            return -2.0 - (pnl_abs - 10) * 0.05
        else:
            return -3.0 - np.tanh((pnl_abs - 30) / 30)
```

## 🎯 Problem Solved: Hold-Only Collapse

### Root Cause
Deterministic MuZero cannot handle market uncertainty:
- Assumes perfect prediction of future states
- Learns that inaction minimizes unpredictable losses
- Collapses to 100% HOLD as "safest" strategy

### Stochastic Solution
- **Explicit Uncertainty**: Models 3 discrete market outcomes
- **Expected Value Planning**: Reasons through multiple scenarios
- **Chance Nodes**: Natural exploration through outcome sampling
- **Adaptive Thresholds**: 0.5σ based on 20-period rolling stdev

### Success Metrics
- Action diversity maintained (no action >40%)
- Positive expectancy achieved
- Win rate 45-55% (consistency over accuracy)
- No collapse to single action

---

## 🚦 Training Timeline

### Phase 1: Buffer Collection (0-100 experiences)
- ~10 minutes to collect initial buffer
- 1 experience per ~6 seconds (MCTS overhead)

### Phase 2: Early Training (Episodes 1-500)
- Initial policy emergence
- High exploration (temperature 10.0 → 5.0)
- Action diversity should be maintained

### Phase 3: Learning (Episodes 500-5000)
- Outcome prediction improves
- Expectancy moves toward positive
- Temperature decays (5.0 → 1.0)

### Phase 4: Refinement (Episodes 5000+)
- Strategy stabilization
- Consistent positive expectancy
- Reduced exploration

---

## ⚠️ Critical Implementation Notes

### 1. Feature Order (MUST match database)
The feature order is CRITICAL and hardcoded in `train_micro_muzero.py`:
- Technical features use lagged columns (e.g., `position_in_range_60_0` through `position_in_range_60_31`)
- Position features are constant across the lag window
- Any mismatch will cause silent training failure

### 2. Reward Clipping
All rewards are clipped to [-3.0, 3.0] to prevent gradient explosion

### 3. CPU-Only Training
Intentionally uses CPU for consistency and reproducibility

### 4. No Priority Replay
TD-error priority removed in favor of simple quota-based balancing

---

## 🎯 Design Rationale & Feature Selection

### Why These 15 Features?

#### Technical Indicators (5)
- **position_in_range_60**: Captures medium-term price context
- **momentum_60 & momentum_5**: Multi-timeframe momentum signals
- **rolling_range**: Volatility for risk assessment
- **price_change_pips**: Immediate price action

*Rationale*: These provide essential price dynamics without redundancy. Each captures a distinct market aspect.

#### Cyclical Time (4)
- **Hour & Day-of-Week encodings**: Market behavior varies by time
- **Sine/Cosine encoding**: Continuous representation of cyclical patterns

*Rationale*: Forex markets have strong intraday and weekly patterns. Encoding time helps the model learn session-specific behaviors.

#### Position State (6)
- **Complete position context**: Side, P&L, duration, drawdown
- **Tanh normalization**: Keeps values bounded for stable learning

*Rationale*: The model MUST understand its current position to make valid decisions. These features prevent invalid actions and enable risk management.

### Why Stochastic MuZero?

Traditional MuZero assumes deterministic transitions: `s' = f(s, a)`. In markets, this fails because:
1. Markets are inherently stochastic
2. The same action in the same state can lead to different outcomes
3. Without modeling uncertainty, the model becomes paralyzed

Our solution: `s' = f(s, a, outcome)` where outcome ∈ {UP, NEUTRAL, DOWN}

---

## 💡 Reward Scheme Philosophy

### The Problem We're Solving

The reward system must balance three competing objectives:
1. **Encourage Trading**: Model must take positions
2. **Manage Risk**: Model must close losing positions
3. **Maximize Profit**: Model must capture winning trades

### Our Solution: Clean Immediate + Delayed Rewards

#### Immediate Rewards (Actions)
```python
BUY/SELL when flat: +1.0  # Reward decisive market entry
HOLD when flat: -0.05     # Gentle push to take action
HOLD in position: 0.0     # Neutral - let position develop
Invalid actions: -1.0      # Strong penalty for rule violations
```

**Rationale**:
- +1.0 for entries creates action bias without specifying direction
- -0.05 idle penalty prevents Hold-only collapse
- 0.0 during trades prevents premature exits
- -1.0 for invalid actions enforces state machine

#### Delayed Rewards (AMDDP1 on CLOSE)

AMDDP1 (Asymmetric Mean Deviation Drawdown Penalty) provides risk-adjusted final evaluation:

```python
Profit ranges:
  0-10 pips:   1.0 + pips*0.05     # Linear small wins
  10-30 pips:  1.5 + (pips-10)*0.025  # Slower growth
  30+ pips:    2.0 + tanh((pips-30)/50)  # Capped large wins

Loss ranges:
  0-10 pips:   -1.0 - pips*0.1     # Harsh on small losses
  10-30 pips:  -2.0 - (pips-10)*0.05  # Moderate penalty
  30+ pips:    -3.0 - tanh((pips-30)/30)  # Capped disasters
```

**Rationale**:
- **Asymmetric**: Losses penalized more than equivalent gains
- **Non-linear**: Encourages consistent small wins over rare large wins
- **Bounded**: Prevents single trades from dominating learning

### Why This Works

1. **Solves Hold-Only**: Immediate +1.0 for entries vs -0.05 for idle
2. **Encourages Exploration**: Model tries different entry points
3. **Risk Management**: AMDDP1 teaches conservative position sizing
4. **State Machine**: Invalid action penalties maintain trading logic
